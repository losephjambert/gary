# planetary
a sass-powered flexbox grid for tomorrow

##directions
1. install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) and be sure to use an autoprefixer of your choice (i really love [codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/))
2. include the mixin.scss and grid.scss in your main.scss stylesheet
3. give your html elements names that make sense to you
4. mixin the containers and columns/rows where you see fit

##about
**planetary** is a flexbox-based grid that uses the SASS preprocessor and the wonders of autoprefixing to create a semantic, customizable, layout module that super-charges your css and keeps your html clean.

**planetary** only works on contemporary browsers and does not support i.e.â€“ 8, 9, 10, and sometimes 11.

developed as a school project and issued under the MIT license, please feel free to use and re-use **planetary** to make it better :)
