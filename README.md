# gary
a mixin flexbox grid

##directions
1. install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/install) and be sure to use an autoprefixer of your choice (i really love [codekit](https://incident57.com/codekit/))
2. include grid.scss in your main.scss stylesheet
3. give your html elements names that make sense to you
4. mixin the containers and columns/rows where you see fit

##about
**gary** is a flexbox-based grid that uses SASS preprocessing and the wonders of autoprefixing to create a semantic, customizable, layout module. i like to use it for simple layouts.

it only works on modern browsers and does not support i.e.â€“ 8, 9, 10, and sometimes 11.

developed as a school project, please feel free to fork **gary** to make it better :)
